# InferenceEngine
Implementation of an inference engine for propositional logic based on the Truth Table (TT) checking, and Backward Chaining (BC) and Forward Chaining (FC) algorithms. The inference engine takes as arguments a Horn-form Knowledge Base KB and a query q which is a proposition symbol and determines whether q can be entailed from KB.
